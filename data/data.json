It was recorded at Transporterraum in New York City with producer Gordon Raphael during March and April 2001. For their debut, the band strived to capture a simple sound that was not significantly enhanced in the studio. Building on their 2001 EP The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during recording sessions, while songwriter and lead singer Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth."

The album features the return of producer Gordon Raphael from Is This It and consists of a slightly smoother sound than its predecessor; i.e. the bass guitar is less present except for several select moments when it becomes the focal point of the song. Its title is drawn from a lyric in 'Reptilia': 'The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair.'"
